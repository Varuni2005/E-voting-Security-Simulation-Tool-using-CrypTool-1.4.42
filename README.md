Cryptography plays a vital role in securing digital information by ensuring confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. With the increasing dependence on electronic communication and data storage, understanding cryptographic algorithms has become essential. This project presents a practical study and simulation of major cryptographic algorithms using the CrypTool software. Algorithms such as AES for symmetric encryption, RSA for asymmetric encryption, SHA-256 for hashing, and RSA-based digital signatures are implemented and analyzed. CrypTool provides a visual and interactive environment to understand how cryptographic techniques work in real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate how cryptographic mechanisms protect sensitive information against unauthorized access and tampering.
